### Situation
Our bodies are complex. And managing diabetes is hard. Once diagnosed, it's very difficult to test (and remember) how our bodies respond to food and exercise.

### Overview
SugarDrop is your go-to app for saying "screw you" to diabetes. Managing diabetes can feel like a guessing game. SugarDrop brings the connection between food intake, physical activity, and blood sugar relative to time into one view â€“ so YOU can see how your body responds to these three components that impact blood sugar and gain control over managing diabetes.
